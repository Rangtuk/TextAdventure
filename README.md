# TextAdventure
  
Personal project of mine, I will be updating the project on NO set schedule, I work on it when I feel like it  
Goal of mine to get more proficient in C#, as well as create something I am interested in making (but work/life comes first)  
If you see code stink, I probably didn't, as of this README I only have about 8 months of moderate C# coding experience, so basically don't expect much  
  
If you happen to clone this project, playtest to your hearts content! Save files have been implemented that will save to your local machine

      * Weapon
      * Armor
      * Potion

* Weapons
   * Melee (Energy Points)
      * Two-hander
         * Big damage, less defense
      * One-hander + Shield
         * Less damage, more defense
      * Dual Wield
         * Faster smaller damage
   * Ranged (Arrows) (Allows Evade to get free attacks)
      * Bow
         * Ranged, quicker damage (standard Evade)
      * Crossbow
         * Ranged, stronger damage (less Evade duration)
   * Magic (Spell Slots)
      * Staff
         * Magic, allows spell casting
* Armors
   * Armor expectations
      * Reduces damage
      * Provides bonuses?
         * To what, if not armor? Has to be magical to give +1 resource?
      * Limits weapon benefit?
         * I.e. Bows/Staves have disadvantage in plate vs. cloth/leather
            * How to allow player to not be utterly screwed out of armor/diff weapon if drops are random? (Since scripted drops on a non-physical game world makes game a storybook over an adventure)
